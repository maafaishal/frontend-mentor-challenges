## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

By default, we need to add this css property to all HTML elements to make the element's padding include its width.

```css
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

### Continued development

I think I will consider to support iPhone 4 dimensions.
